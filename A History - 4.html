      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>Until the 17th century Harrogate was just a quiet hamlet. Then in the late 16th century a man named William Slingsby drank from a well. He had traveled to several spas and he realised the well water tasted like spa water. Slingsby discovered Tewit Well, which is a chalybeate well (one containing iron). People believed that drinking water from such a well would heal sicknesses. So Harrogate began to grow into a spa town.</p>
      <p>Harrogate grew more after 1631 when a man named Dr Michael Stanhope discovered a second well, St John's Well also known as the Sweet Spa.</p>
      <p>During the 17th century Harrogate slowly grew. By the mid 17th century people bathed in a sulphur well (known as the stinking well) as well as drinking water from the chalybeate wells. Furthermore in the late 17th century the first inns were visitors could stay were built.</p>
      <p>In the late 18th century much public land was enclosed (that is divided up between various people). However when the land at Harrogate was enclosed in 1770 it was decided to dedicate 200 acres to the public.</p>
      <p>Wedderburn House was built in 1786. Harrogate's Georgian theatre was built in 1788. Meanwhile a chapel dedicated to St John was built in 1749. In the 19th century it was replaced by Christ Church, which was consecrated in 1831.</p>
